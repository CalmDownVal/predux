# Predux

An opinionated take on the good ol' Redux trying to enforce best practices
wherever possible.

These libraries are in experimental state. Breaking changes may occur in between
minor versions. Requires TypeScript >=3.8.

This is a monorepo containing the store implementation as well as bindings for
Preact. For detailed information about the individual modules, refer to their
respective readme files:

- [predux](packages/predux)
- [preact-predux](packages/preact-predux)

## ToDO

- Tests, tests, tests! Current coverage is 0%
- Measure performance (count re-renders)
- Create a debugging middleware/plugin
- Get to a v1.0 release
