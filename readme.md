# Predux

An opinionated take on the good ol' Redux trying to enforce best practices
wherever possible.

This is a monorepo containing the store implementation as well as bindings for
Preact. For detailed information about the individual modules, refer to their
respective readme files:

- [predux](packages/predux)
- [preact-predux](packages/preact-predux)

## ToDO

- Tests, tests, tests! Current coverage is 0%
- Measure performance (re-render counts)
- Some more docs
- Create a debugging middleware/plugin
- Get to a v1.0 release
